# Gesture-Controlled-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was made during our college course "Interaction" at TH NÃ¼rnberg. The goal of the project was using OpenFrameworks and C++ to learn more about image processing, color tracking and contour finding. The Project features a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game supported by gesture controls.

## Installation process for code contributions

### 1. Download and install OpenFrameworks
- Visit https://openframeworks.cc/download/ and download the library for your operating system.
- Unzip the folder into your IDEs projects folder (we will call it OF-root directory in the following readme)
- Download the addon oxfCv from https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv/archive/master.zip 
- Unzip and rename it into ofxCv, then put it into the OF-root directory into /addons/
- THAT'S IT !

### 2. Preparing an OpenFrameworks project for your IDE
- Open the OpenFrameworks ProjectGenerator in its folder "projectGenerator" in the OF-root directory you prepared in step 1
- You will need to pick a name for your new project and select additional libaries. An actual list of required addons can be found in the addons.make file in our GitHub repository
- Your project will be created in the directory /apps/myApps/ of the OF-root directory

### 3. Checking out the source code into your IDE
- Now you can open the project in your IDE and check out your preferred build version from our GitHub repository!
